# üè• VCH HOME HEALTH üè•

Home Health is a Learning Technologies and VCH project created using Jekyll.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Home Health utilizes Jekyll and Gulp to compile markdown and sass into a flat file website.  The final output / compilation can be found in "_site".

## üñ• Building / Debugging

I have included my gulpfile.js so you should be able to navigate to the root directory, install the required packages and simply run:

```bash
$ gulp
```

This will build the debugging version of the site and launch browsersync which is a local web server used to see your changes in real time. do __not__ try to deploy this build as the links will most likely not work

## ‚§¥Ô∏è Deployment

When you are ready to deploy run the following command which uses a seperate deployemnt config file and build to _deploy

```bash
$ jekyll build --config deploy.config.yml --destination _deploy
```


## üñã Editting Content
Home Health's content can all be found in the 'modules' folder as seen in the file structure above.  In this section I will explain how each page type's markup (with a unique layout in the _layouts folder) is compiled into the final html.

This layout is used for each Case Study found under each module.  This page has not been completed

```yaml

This page takes quite a bit of custom frontmatter to generate a pretty customizable page.  Inside a nested list named 'sections', you can create sub lists that will be rendered within the section as a 'part'.  Parts can be rendered on the left half, the right half, or fill the entire section 
    
```yaml
sections:
  #declare a section like this, you can have as many sections as you want
  - section:

    #Sections can have either just one full part, a left part and a right part, or all three parts.  
    - part: left | right | full #must be one of these 3 types

      #title of part
      title: A Great Title 

      #Text block that will appear in the part
      text: lots of great information

      # A block that takes in an array and displays mutiple small circles containing images
      circles: ['thing', 'thing', 'thing'] 

      # A block that takes in an array and displays mutiple questions
      questions: ['How did you feel?', 'What were the ramifications?']
