# üè• VCH HOME HEALTH üè•

Home Health is a Learning Technologies and VCH project created using Jekyll.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Home Health utilizes Jekyll and Gulp to compile markdown and sass into a flat file website.  The final output / compilation can be found in "_site".

## üñ• Building / Debugging

I have included my gulpfile.js so you should be able to navigate to the root directory, install the required packages and simply run:

```bash
$ gulp
```

This will build the debugging version of the site and launch browsersync which is a local web server used to see your changes in real time. do __not__ try to deploy this build as the links will most likely not work

## ‚§¥Ô∏è Deployment

When you are ready to deploy run the following command which uses a seperate deployemnt config file and build to _deploy

```bash
$ gulp deploy
```


## üñã Editting Content
Home Health's content can all be found in the 'modules' folder as seen in the file structure above.  In this section I will explain how each page type's markup (with a unique layout in the _layouts folder) is compiled into the final html.

<details><summary>

[ /_layouts/case-study.html ]

This layout is used for each Case Study found under each module.  This page has not been completed

```yaml

This page takes quite a bit of custom frontmatter to generate a pretty customizable page.  Inside a nested list named 'sections', you can create sub lists that will be rendered within the section as a 'part'.  Parts can be rendered on the left half, the right half, or fill the entire section 
    
```yaml
sections:
  #declare a section like this, you can have as many sections as you want
  - section:

    #Sections can have either just one full part, 2 half parts, or all three parts.  
    - part: half | full #must be one of these 2 types

      #title of part
      title: A Great Title 

      #Text block that will appear in the part
      text: lots of great information

      #Display an embedded youtube video, just input youtube embed url
      youtube: https://www.youtube.com/embed/xw9BBb8LhYw

      #display a locally hosted video, just input the file path
      video: folder/video.mp4

      #lazy way add padding
      spacer-title: asdfasdfadf

      #due to limitations with YAML Frontmatter, I have created duplicate title and text blocks with the suffix '-2' so you
      #can use more then one per part if needed (you can only use on of a block type per part)
      title-2: A Title
      text-2: Some text

      # A block that takes in a list and displays circles containing images
      circles:
        - Title: image.png
        - Spiritual: modules/pcc/topic/holistic/spiritual.png
        - Cultural: modules/pcc/topic/holistic/cultural.png

      # A block that takes in an array and displays mutiple questions
      questions: ['How did you feel?', 'What were the ramifications?'] 

      # A block that creates a matching quiz (this whole layout thing is such a hack so I apologies for these janky blocks)
      quiz-matching:
        # first you define category names and images to represent them
        - category: [Depression, topic/deppression.jpg]
        - category: [Delirium, topic/delirium.jpg]
        - category: [Dementia, topic/dementia.jpg]

        #You then define items that fall under your define categories, the user will have to match them up
        - Depression: 'Sudden Onset'
        - Delirium: 'Medical Emergency'
        - Depression: 'Wandering'
        - Dementia: 'Memory disturbances'
        - Dementia: 'Hopelessness'
