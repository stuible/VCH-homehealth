    text: Luigi is an 82 year old man from Italy who came to Canada in his early 20’s with his wife of 57 years, Rosa. They have 4 adult children and 12 grandchildren, most of them living locally. Luigi is a retired, previously self-employed, bricklayer who enjoys spending time with his garden as well as making wine from the grapes he grows.  Luigi has an active social life visiting friends and family.  Luigi and Rosa would attend their local community center twice weekly to swim. On Sunday’s they would attend church services followed by having family and friends over for dinner.

    text: Luigi has COPD, GERD, HTN, CAD, high cholesterol, PVD, cataract surgery to both eyes, stage C heart failure and type 2 diabetes which has led to frequent hospitalizations over the past four years. Most recently he suffered from a right brain CVA resulting in left sided weakness, unclear speech and difficulties swallowing resulting in seven weeks of hospitalization.  Luigi’s medical condition is now stable, and he was discharged home. He is currently total care, and PT has been working with him on strengthening exercises, but progression is slow and he’s losing hope he will be able to work in his garden again.

    text: Luigi wants to eat the great food Rosa cooks, but did not pass the swallowing assessment prior to discharge. He currently is receiving nutritional intake via a PEG tube. Luigi is not ambulating so needs a mechanical lift to get into the wheelchair. He is also incontinent of urine and has sensation with his bowels so can use a commode.


supports:  Rosa is worried about caring for Luigi as they live alone and although the family is close; they all work full time and have their own families to care for as well.  Rosa too has been showing signs of forgetfulness. The family was hoping that Luigi could be transferred to a transition facility, but Luigi wanted to go home. Luigi and Rosa own their home but have limited income and not able to pay for private care.  They are currently receiving four hours of home support under long term care with a small daily per diem. Community health workers come to assist in the early in the morning to help with care, at lunch to help get him out of bed, late afternoon to help get him back to bed,  and then in the evening to help settle him at night. 

medications:
  - salbutamol 100 mcg inhalation QID  
  - ipratopium bromide 200 mcg  inhalation BID 
  - Metformin 500 mg BID
  - Pantaloc 40 mg po OD
  - Lasix 40 mg po OD
  - Captopril 12.5 mg po OD
  - Lipitor 40 mg po OD
  - Multivitamins once per day
  - Tylenol as needed


initial-visit: Luigi’s legs are swelling more and he hit his leg on the wheelchair and now has a large open area to his right lower leg. Rosa is feeling overwhelmed with trying to keep track of his blood sugars, medications, and tube feeds. Luigi desperately wants to have something to eat and he admits he has had some pasta. Their children have been taking turns visiting daily and Rosa insists on making dinner for everyone.

reflection:
  - What might you ask Luigi to contribute to your holistic assessment of his health and situation? 
  - How might you engage  with Luigi, Rosa and the adult children to support the care needs they identify?
  - What considerations need to be made with Luigi’s right to live at risk by eating?
  - What are some potential resources or other people that could be accessed to support Luigi?
  - What might be involved in co-creating a care plan for this family?
