    text: A few years ago May was diagnosed with ALS. Her symptoms have been worsening and is she requiring more care. Although working full-time, her husband David is taking on more responsibilities with the children. David is sometimes abrupt when communicating between May and their children, complaining that he always feels tired.

    image: margaret/3.png
    text: May is afraid of how her symptoms will develop and grows increasingly upset about her diagnosis. She feels that she’s losing control physically and mentally, and cries often when she alone. May wants to be a good wife and mother and take care of the family, but feels she is not able to. May is developing a pressure sore on her coccyx from sitting for long periods. She is having trouble with swallowing and occasionally panics that she cannot breathe. Pain has been increasing the stiffer her limbs and joints get from staying in one position. Finally she is now experiencing urinary retention and may require a foley catheter. May has been seeing a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner who performs acupuncture and supplies her traditional Chinese medicine.


supports:  May does not have close family in Canada. The couple have been working on sponsoring May’s parents and younger sister from China but are facing difficulties. She is receiving one hour a day of home support under long term care in the morning to assist her with bathing and dressing. Due to the high daily per diem, David has been considering switching to private care. May had once been quite involved with the Chinese community and had volunteered in many activities at her church.

medications:
  - Chinese herbal medication
  - Extra strength acetaminophen (3-4 times per week)

visit: 
  Initial Visit: Using a translator to help communicate, May shares she is experiencing increased fatigue, pain and decreased appetite. May is staying in bed for longer periods during the day. You notice her grimace when she turns in bed and she winces as she sits up. May states that up until a month ago she had been feeling very well. Her mood is low and she is crying at times throughout the day, although never in front of the children.  She became tearful when speaking about David’s love and the responsibilities that he has taken over from her. She is not able to actively participate in her faith community. She no longer feels she is able to be the mother to her children that she wants to be.  David has left you a note asking you to text or email him about how is wife is doing.

reflection:
  - What are some strategies for effective communication when using family, friends or services for translation?
  - Under what circumstances can text or email be used when communicating with clients and families?
  - What might you ask May to contribute to your holistic assessment of her health and situation? 
  - How might you engage with May and her family to support the care needs they identify?
