      - answer:
        text: Get over this and toss it up to the client just being this way

      - answer:
        text: Will ask the clinical lead (WOCN, CRN) to join me for a follow up  visit
        feedback: Clients do not always develop trust relationships with clinicians. Having someone else come in and provide perspective and understanding of the care plan may provide more clarity to the client and lead to clearer understanding about the care provided.
