      - answer:
        text: Take the first opportunity while still in Ms. Patel’s home to sanitize my hands with my pre-packed sanitizer and paper towels.
        feedback: While it is important to build trust with clients it is critical to maintain best practice in hygiene. Avoid client’s towels as these are considered a potential source of contamination.  In the client’s home, always use your pre-packed VCH approved  supply of soap and hand sanitizer with paper towels.

      - answer:
        text: I wait until I finish the visit and in my car for a thorough post-visit hand sanitation.
        feedback: "Waiting to sanitize your hands means a higher risk of infection: Anything touched from the time of contamination is also considered contaminated.  In the client’s home, always use your pre-packed VCH approved  supply of soap and hand sanitizer with paper towels."

      - answer:
        text: Continue the visit as planned knowing that I have avoided potential infection.
        feedback: Infection control is critical for the community nurse and it is wise to avoid the client’s towel. However while doing so try to build trust with your client in other ways.  In the client’s home, always use your pre-packed VCH approved  supply of soap and hand sanitizer with paper towels.

      - answer:
        text: Kindly explain that I brought my own hand hygiene supplies.
        feedback: Congratulations, this is the best alternative.  You are right to gently reject your client’s offer and follow best practice for hand hygiene.  Have your VCH approved supply of soap and hand sanitizer with paper towels packed and ready to use in the clients’ home.
