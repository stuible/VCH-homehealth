    text: Franny is a 48 year old woman that lives in a four story walk up apartment building.  Originally from small town Saskatchewan, Franny moved west about 14 years ago after she divorced her ex-husband of 12 years. She is from a large conservative family and her father was the town’s minister. During the marriage, Franny went through some challenging times not being able to conceive due to endometriosis and she was also diagnosed with depression.

    text: When Franny located to Vancouver for a fresh start, she did not know anyone and had little support from family or friends back home who disapproved of her divorce. Franny was diagnosed with bipolar Type 1 disorder about 10 years ago after going through a manic episode where she was self-medicating with street drugs. Subsequently, she contracted Hepatitis C.  After Franny completed her drug rehabilitation, she met her current partner Paula. Paula is Metis, also from the prairies, and the two moved in together after dating for six months.

She has been experiencing significant nausea with the chemo and is using medicinal marijuana to help control it.
