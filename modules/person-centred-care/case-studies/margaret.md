title: Margaret’s Story

background: May is a 38 year old woman who was sponsored by her husband from China about 12 years ago and soon got married and had children. They have 3 children Kevin (11 years old),Dianne (9 years old) and Bobby (4 years old); who attend private school. She speaks Mandarin and her verbal and written English is limited. Her husband David is a COO at a computer software engineering company and speaks and writes English fluently.  

medications:
  - Chinese herbal medication
  - Extra strength acetaminophen (3-4 times per week)

initial-visit: Using a translator to help communicate, May shares she is experiencing increased fatigue, pain and decreased appetite. May is staying in bed for longer periods during the day. You notice her grimace when she turns in bed and she winces as she sits up. May states that up until a month ago she had been feeling very well. Her mood is low and she is crying at times throughout the day. She became tearful when speaking about David’s love and the responsibilities that he has taken over from her. She is not able to actively participate in her faith community. She no longer feels she is able to be the mother to her children that she wants to be.

reflection:
  - What are some things to consider when using family or friends to help translate?
  - What are some strategies to have effective communication when using a translation services?
  - What might you ask May to contribute to your holistic assessment of her health and situation? 
  - How might you engage  with May, David and the children to support the care needs they identify?

May was diagnosed a few years ago with ALS and is now
developing increasing symptoms requiring more care. Her
husband is abrupt in some of the communications with
his wife and children and always feels tired. He is working
fulltime and is now taking on more responsibilities with
the children. May does not have family in Canada at this
time. The couple have been working on sponsoring her
young sister and parents over from China; however, there
have been some difficulties. May has been quite involved
with the Chinese community and participated in many 
volunteer activities at the church she attends.

May is afraid of how the symptoms will develop and is
really upset about her diagnosis. She feels like she is
losing control physically and mentally. She wants to be a
good wife, mother and take care of the family, but is not
able to fulfill these roles. She is starting to get a pressure
sore on her coccyx from sitting for long periods. She is
having harder time with swallowing and occasionally panics
