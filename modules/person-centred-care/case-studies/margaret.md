title: Margaret’s Story

background: 

medications:
  - Chinese herbal medication
  - Extra strength acetaminophen (3-4 times per week)

initial-visit: Using a translator to help communicate, Margaret shares she is experiencing increased fatigue, pain and decreased appetite. Margaret is staying in bed for longer periods during the day. You notice her grimace when she turns in bed and she winces as she sits up. Margaret states that up until a month ago she had been feeling very well. Her mood is low and she is crying at times throughout the day, although never in front of the children.  She became tearful when speaking about David’s love and the responsibilities that he has taken over from her. She is not able to actively participate in her faith community. She no longer feels she is able to be the mother to her children that she wants to be.

reflection:
  - What are some things to consider when using family or friends to help translate?
  - What are some strategies to have effective communication when using a translation services?
  - What might you ask May to contribute to your holistic assessment of her health and situation? 
  - How might you engage  with May, David and the children to support the care needs they identify?

Margaret is a 38 year old woman who was sponsored by her husband from China about 12 years ago and soon got married and had children. They have 3 children Kevin (11 years old), Dianne (9 years old) and Bobby (4 years old); who attend private school. She speaks Mandarin and her verbal and written English is limited. Her husband David is a COO at a computer software engineering company and he speaks and writes English fluently.

Margaret was diagnosed a few years ago with ALS and is now developing increasing symptoms requiring more care.  Her husband is abrupt in some of the communication with his wife and children and always feels tired. He is working fulltime and is now taking on more responsibilities with the children.

Margaret is afraid of how the symptoms will develop and is really upset about her diagnosis. She feels like she is losing control physically and mentally, and cries often when she alone.  Margaret wants to be a good wife, mother and take care of the family, but is not able to fulfill these roles.  She is starting to get a pressure sore on her coccyx from sitting for long periods. She is having harder time with swallowing and occasionally panics that she cannot breathe.  Pain is also starting to be an issue, as it gets worse the more she stays in one position because her limbs and joints get stiff.  She is now experiencing urinary retention and may require a foley catheter. Margaret has been seeing a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner who does acupuncture and supplies traditional Chinese medicine to cure her disease.
