Recently Ajit fell and fractured his hip. Fortunately the building manager found him and called the ambulance. After an extended time in the hospital he persuaded the doctor and the occupational therapist that he could return home. In the hospital, he had his right hip pinned, that was further complicated by post-op delirium tremors and pneumonia. He also developed a DVT in his right leg which he is now on warfarin and requires regular blood work. He has significant arthritis in his hands, which makes it difficult to open pill bottles and do actions requiring fine motor skills.  Rohit’s son has been visiting the hospital and indicating he has been staying at his dad’s place and will help him when he gets discharged.
