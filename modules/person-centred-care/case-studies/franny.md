  - Do you have any preconceived ideas when caring for clients with mental health challenges or substance use disorder? What are they?
  - Are there any potential implications with clients using cannabis? 
  - What might you ask Franny to contribute to your holistic assessment of her health and situation? 
  - How might you engage  with Franny and Paula to support the care needs they identify?
  - What are some potential resources or other people that could be accessed to support Franny?

During the marriage, Franny went through some challenging times not being able to conceive due to endometriosis and she was also diagnosed with depression. When Franny located to Vancouver for a fresh start, she did not know anyone and had little support from family or friends back home who disapproved of her divorce.   Franny was diagnosed with bipolar Type 1 disorder about 10 years ago after going through a manic episode where she was self medicating with street drugs. Subsequently, she contracted Hepatitis C. After Franny completed her drug rehabilitation, she met her current partner Paula. Paula is Metis, also from the prairies, and the two moved in together after dating for six months. Six months ago, Franny was diagnosed with stage III ovarian cancer and immediately started on chemotherapy. She has been experiencing significant nausea with the chemo and is using medicinal marijuana to help control it. Paula was concerned about Franny using medicinal marijuana because of her history with substance use disorder. Paula has been talking to an elder about doing a healing circle for Franny.
