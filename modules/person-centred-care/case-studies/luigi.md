title: Luigi’s Story

background: Luigi is an 82 year old gentleman from Italy who came to Canada in his early 20’s with his wife Rosa who he has been married to for 57 years. They have 4 adult children and 12 grandchildren, most of them living locally. Luigi is a retired, previously self employed, bricklayer who enjoys spending time with his garden as well as making wine from the grapes he grows. He has an active social life visiting friends and family.  Luigi and Rosa would attend their local community center twice a weekly to swim. On Sunday’s they would attend church services and go out to lunch with friends then have the family over for dinner in the evenings.

initial-visit: Luigi’s legs are swelling more and he hit his leg on the wheelchair and now has a large open area to his right lower leg. Rosa is feeling overwhelmed with trying to keep track of his blood sugars, medications, and tube feeds. Luigi desperately wants to have something to eat and he admits he has had some pasta. Their children have been taking turns visiting daily and Rosa insists on making dinner for everyone.

reflection:
  - What might you ask Luigi to contribute to your holistic assessment of his health and situation?
  - How might you engage  with Luigi, Rosa and the adult children to support the care needs they identify?
  - What considerations need to be made with Luigi’s right to live at risk by eating?
  - What are some potential resources or other people that could be accessed to support Luigi?
  - What might be involved in co-creating a care plan for this family?

Luigi has COPD,GERD,  HTN, CAD, high cholesterol, PVD,  cataract surgery to both eyes, stage C  heart failure and type 2 diabetes which has lead to frequent hospitalizations over the past four years. Most recently he suffered from a right brain CVA resulting in left sided weakness, unclear speech and difficulties swallowing resulting in seven weeks of hospitalization.  His medical condition is now stable, and he was discharged home.  Luigi is currently total care, and PT has been working with him on strengthening exercises, but progression is slow and he’s losing hope he will be able to work in his garden again. 

Luigi wants to eat the great food Rosa cooks, but did not pass the swallowing assessment prior to discharge.  He currently is receiving nutritional intake via a PEG tube.  Luigi is not ambulating so needs a mechanical lift to get into the wheelchair. He is also incontinent of urine and has sensation with his bowels so can use a commode.
